# NY Events

This project is a full-stack web application for managing and showcasing events. It consists of both frontend and backend components. The frontend, built using React, provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with event data, while the backend handles data storage, retrieval, and other server-side functionalities.

The application allows users to view details of various events, such as event name, date, location, description, and website link. Users can also add, edit, and delete events based on their permissions. The frontend communicates with the backend through API endpoints to perform CRUD operations on event data.
